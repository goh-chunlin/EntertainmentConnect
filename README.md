## Project Description

Entertainment Connect allows you to play your songs and videos stored in Microsoft OneDrive on your Windows 8 device directly.

Unlike most of the other solutions, this application able to keep streamed videos and audios in background and play them later. Hence, the user can switch between different media files in the application smoothly.

Entertainment Connect is built with WinJS: https://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/winjs.

It is also a submission for the 2014 Microsoft //publish/ hackathon in Singapore: http://www.spiffy.sg/students/lets-geek-out-microsofts-publish/.

## Notes

Before you compile the project, please make sure that you will do it in Visual Studio 2012 or above.

After that, please associate the app with the Windos Store under your account so that Visual Studio will download the correct values to your local app manifest. The existing package.appxmanifest file is just a sample. You can remove it.

Due to the fact that this project was started before SkyDrive is renamed to OneDrive, part of the code is still using the term "SkyDrive".
